== What is this? ==

Scripts for generating and displaying a self-organising map of gene
expression data from multiple experiments.

Documentation for running the pipeline in-house at VectorBase is
available here: http://wiki.vectorbase.org/index.php/Expression_maps

== What's included? ==

=== sql/schema.sql ===
This is the schema for the database - load it before starting any scripts.

=== scripts/cluster-continuous-data.pl ===
This is the main script for generating the map.

=== scripts/run-go-ora.pl ===
This runs the ermineJ GO enrichment analysis
(http://www.chibi.ubc.ca/ermineJ/) on the genes in each map cluster
and loads the results into the database

=== web/map.cgi ===
The new web front end.  Makes heavy AJAX use of web/json.cgi.
web/index.cgi is the old Web1.0 front end (more functionality but
very clunky).

== What's not included ==

Software for generating/normalising the input expression data matrix.
Example input data can be found on the VectorBase download
site: http://www.vectorbase.org/GetData/Downloads/?&type=Expression&archive_status=current ("shifted-means" files).

The gene annotation file ('biomart.txt'), needed for the GO enrichment
analysis and the web interface, is not provided, nor is an example of
these files.  It is, however, a tab-delimited file which has the
following column headings: 'Ensembl Gene ID', 'Description',
'Anopheles symbol', 'GO ID', 'GO description', 'Interpro ID',
'Interpro Description'.
